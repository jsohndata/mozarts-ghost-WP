## 🤖 AI Collaboration

This plugin is the result of **AI-assisted development** — a process where AI acts as a creative and technical partner.

- **Step 1:** Converted the original JavaScript to a WordPress-compatible plugin using **ChatGPT 3.x** (pre–4.0).  
- **Step 2:** Enhanced functionality and refined the code with **ChatGPT 4.0** and **Claude 3.7**.  
- **Step 3:** Maintained the original spirit while modernizing for WordPress environments.

This wasn’t just AI as a tool — it was a **true collaboration**, with AI contributing ideas, code, and refinements.

## 📖 Backstory

The idea for *Mozart’s Ghost* started years ago during my days teaching software engineering. Inspired by a brief moment in *The Net*, I loved the concept of a “backdoor” — not in a malicious sense, but as a clever, hidden element within code.

I originally wrote this as a **JavaScript teaching demo**, showing different logic structures and switch statements, and sneaking in a playful “backdoor” for demonstration purposes.  

Over the years, it became my homage to that little snippet from the movie.
