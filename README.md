# Mozart’s Ghost – WordPress Plugin

**A nostalgic nod to a hidden gem from the 1995 Sandra Bullock film *The Net* — reimagined with AI-assisted development for the WordPress era.**

## 📖 Backstory

The idea for *Mozart’s Ghost* started years ago during my days teaching software engineering. Inspired by a brief moment in *The Net*, I loved the concept of a “backdoor” — not in a malicious sense, but as a clever, hidden element within code.

I originally wrote this as a **JavaScript teaching demo**, showing different logic structures and switch statements, and sneaking in a playful “backdoor” for demonstration purposes.  

Over the years, it became my homage to that little snippet from the movie.

## 🚀 From JavaScript to WordPress (with AI Collaboration)

In its current form, *Mozart’s Ghost* has been transformed into a **WordPress plugin** through a collaborative process I like to call **AI-assisted development** — a workflow where AI plays a creative and technical partner role.

- **Step 1:** Converted the original JavaScript to a WordPress-compatible plugin using **ChatGPT 3.x** (pre–4.0).  
- **Step 2:** Enhanced functionality and refined the code with **ChatGPT 4.0** and **Claude 3.7**.  
- **Step 3:** Maintained the spirit of the original, while modernizing for WordPress environments.

I believe AI deserves credit here — this was not just “AI as a tool” but a true collaboration.
